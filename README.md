# dotfiles
---
I use bash, vim and tmux in my terminal. In this repo you will find all my config files for these tools.
## How to use ?
First, you will need to install a plugin manager. (I personally use plug-vim)
Then, you just go into the dotfiles repo and use the Makefile, you'll get all the config files + your previous config files will be backup up.
