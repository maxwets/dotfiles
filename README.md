## How to install ?
You can easily copy my config files to your $HOME by doing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxwets/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
make config
make i3-plasma
```
Then, you can install all the packageges I use by doing (currently supported OS are Arch/Debian based):
```bash
sudo ./install <package manager>
```
